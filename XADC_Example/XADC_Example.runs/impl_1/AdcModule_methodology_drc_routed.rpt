2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell led_reg[3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) led_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[2] relative to clock(s) sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[3] relative to clock(s) sys_clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[0]/L7 (in led_reg[0] macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[0]/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[1]/L7 (in led_reg[1] macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[1]/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[2]/L7 (in led_reg[2] macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[2]/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch led_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin led_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
