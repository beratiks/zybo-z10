2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-11#1 Warning
DSP output not registered  
DSP instance led_b_pwm/sig_pwm_pin5 is not fully pipelined on the output side. MREG/PREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-11#2 Warning
DSP output not registered  
DSP instance led_b_pwm/sig_pwm_pin5__0 is not fully pipelined on the output side. MREG/PREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-11#3 Warning
DSP output not registered  
DSP instance led_g_pwm/sig_pwm_pin5 is not fully pipelined on the output side. MREG/PREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-11#4 Warning
DSP output not registered  
DSP instance led_g_pwm/sig_pwm_pin5__0 is not fully pipelined on the output side. MREG/PREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-11#5 Warning
DSP output not registered  
DSP instance led_r_pwm/sig_pwm_pin5 is not fully pipelined on the output side. MREG/PREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-11#6 Warning
DSP output not registered  
DSP instance led_r_pwm/sig_pwm_pin5__0 is not fully pipelined on the output side. MREG/PREG are not used.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -16.731 ns between led_r_pwm/sig_pwm_pin5/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and led_r_pwm/sig_pwm_pin_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -16.925 ns between led_g_pwm/sig_pwm_pin5/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and led_g_pwm/sig_pwm_pin_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -16.975 ns between led_b_pwm/sig_pwm_pin5/CLK (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and led_b_pwm/sig_pwm_pin_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

An input delay is missing on btn[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn[2] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on btn[3] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[2] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on sw[3] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>
